# 7th Cavalry Zulu Conversion Display (Firefox)

This extension appends a conversion to your local timezone after any zulu times displayed on 7cav.us. It supports all common formatting for the time: with or without a colon or space, Z or Zulu.

For example:
0800Z

Becomes:
0800Z (0200CST)

Your timezone is detected using your system timezone, and the timezone abbreviation is set in the extension options.

Permissions are set for 7cav.us only, so it won't sit there scanning every webpage you visit.
